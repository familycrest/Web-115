I was not able to complete last week's assignment, so I didn't post that here.
    
    I've never used GitHub before. Unless I used it for downloading programs,
but I think I just used the Arch AUR for that. So far, it's fine. I've had no problems
using it. Except for GitHub Desktop. I'm using Linux, so I can't use that. I'll
have to stick to the command line, but I don't mind. I use it a decent amount, anyway.

    I know GitHub will be useful soon. I haven't really made any real programs yet, but
when I do I will be able to start building up my portfolio on GitHub. Doing that is vital
for getting a job. Once I get a programming job it will be even more important and I'm 
sure I'll have to use it constantly to collaborate with others.
